# Lecture 3: Optimze the code

## Introduction

Now we have an AI model based on Neural Network. In the last lecture we trained the network with just one data. We have to train the model with thousands of data to improve it and start using it.
In order to do that we have to do these two things

1. Optimize the code so that it can run the learning step on thousands of data.
2. Optimze the code to save the learnt Weight(Importance) and Bias(Base knowlege) and use it during the prediction.
3. Change the code from javascript to typescript to make the system strongly typed.
