# Neural Networks lecture series

## Introduction

I am a software engineer good in full stack web development. But when it comes to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, I fail. I've tried multiple times to cross this barrier but never did. It has been 6 years since I started but still in level zero. Finally I found why, I love to learn while teaching.

## Challenges addressed

1. The Neural Networks terminologies are overwhelming.
2. How does it work internally?

## Target audience

Anyone interested in Neural Networks but don't know where to start can take up this lecture series.

## Things to understand before the lecture

1. Neural Networks is a vast and deep concept so it is not possible to cover everything.
2. There will be times where you will have to focus on the concept than the calculation, I will highlight there to ignore the technical item which will be covered later.
3. Some technical concepts may be a deep rabbit hole. It makes us deviate from our scope. So I will give lead and you can cover them on your own interest. But I assure you, it will not affect your learning in this lecture.
4. It is not "Build from scratch" lecture series, moreover it is "What's happening under the hood?" type.

## Prerequisites

1. Basic coding knowledge
2. Nodejs as this series is based on Nodejs
